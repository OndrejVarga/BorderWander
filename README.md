# BorderWander - a gamified approach to walking 

This conference-winning application was created as a part of the 2021 FLL competition.

## About project
The ambition of this project was to create an application that not only helps to create the habit of regular walking but also transforms it into an engaging experience. Users get to claim real-world territory with each daily walk, forming unique shapes as they go. These territories earn them points and a piece of the map to call their own. Yet, there's also a friendly competition element – users can challenge each other by walking over their territories. Our solution leverages the inherent human drive for competition and rivalry, turning it into a powerful motivator for regular app engagement. 

BorderWander doesn't stop at gamification; it offers users statistics including captured territory, distance travelled, points earned, calories burned, and leaderboard rankings. In addition, users can personalize their experience with buyable colours and character personalization.
