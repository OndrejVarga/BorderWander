## About project
The ambition of this project was to create an application that not only help to creates the habit of regular walking but also transforms it into an engaging experience. Users stake their claim on real-world territory through their daily walks. The territories are captured by creating a convex shapes by walking. They are rewarded by points as well as the part of map that belongs to them. However, users can conquer each other's territories by walking over them. Our solution leverages the inherent human drive for competition and rivalry, turning it into a powerful motivator for regular app engagement. 

BorderWander doesn't stop at gamification; it offers users a wealth of insightful statistics, including captured territory, distance traveled, points earned, calories burned, and leaderboard rankings. Additionally, users can personalize their experience with buyable colors and character personalization.
